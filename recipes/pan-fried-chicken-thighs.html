<p>Simple pan fried chicken thighs<br>
    Fantastic with rice and vegtable side dish.
</p>


<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4-8 chicken thighs. This should make enough marinate for probable up to 800grams of chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1x tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1x tbsp oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1x tbsp shaoxing cooking wine. Other rice wines will work too</li>
    <li>1x tsp salt</li>
    <li>1x tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbsp corn starch for marinate plus extra for dusting</li>
    <li>1/2 red onion</li>
    <li>2-4 cloves of garlic</li>


</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>combine the soy, oyster, wine, salt, sugar, pepper and corn starch in a bowl and mix till combined.</li>
    <li>Add chicken to bowl and set aside to marinate for atleast 10 minutes but preferably over night.</li>
    <li>Dry and then dust the chicken thighs with corn starch</li>
    <li>Slice garlic and onion and set aside</li>
    <li>Cook chicken thighs in pan with oil on medium. This should be roughly 10 minutes. Try not to move the chicken as this may cause the chicken to lose its crispy coating </li>
    <li>Flip the chicken to cook the other side till crispy.</li>
    <li>Add sliced onion and garlic and fry until aromatic.</li>
    <li>Add a splash of shaoxing cooking wine onto the garlic and onions.</li>
    <li>Cover pan with lid until for a minute or so and serve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
I prefer using ghee as the cooking oil and for a less healthy but tastier meal I like to use enough ghee so that is still a few tbsps worth left when you add the garlic, onions and wine. This will make a great sauce to pout over rice.
<br>Serve with rice and vegtables.
