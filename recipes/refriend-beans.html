<p>A simple bean dish that will last well in the fridge and wont taste any worse after its been there for a few days.<br>
    Goes will in Tacos, Burritoes, Lettuce wraps or my favourite way, just served with plain corn chips and sprouts.

</p>


<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1x can of refried beans</li>
    <li>1x Onion</li>
    <li>2-5 Cloves of Garlic</li>
    <li>1 (or more) Chillis </li>
    <li>1-2 TBSPs worths of spices. "Taco seasoning" works well, <br> as does Garam Masala or a cobination of cumin/chilli/coriander powder. </li>
    <li>Optional: 1 cup of stock</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add oil to pan and saute the Onions.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and chilli, season with salt.</li>
    <li>Add the spices and stir for atleast a few minutes. <br>For best results you want the spices fully incororated and have the mixtures start to release oil.</li>
    <li>Add can of refried beans and stock, cook for atleast 15mins</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
    Garnish with coriander/cheese/lime juice if you wish. <br> Eat with corn chips, tortillas, lettuce or rice.
