    <p>A very simple japanese side dish that is more than the sum of its parts. <br>
    Goes well as a side to meal with rice and can be eaten hot or cold.
    </p>


    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>1x can of Tuna (personally I like the chilli tuna but any can will do)</li>
        <li>2x tsp of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1x tsp of seasame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop cabbage</li>
        <li>Add the thicker stalk part of the cabbage to to pot of bioling water</li>
        <li>Wait about 30 seconds or so after adding the thicker bits of cabbage, then add the rest of the cabbage to the pot and cook for about 30 seconds. <br>The idea is to have all the peices cooked evenly by staggering when theyre added to the water.</li>
        <li>Add cooked strained cabbage and Tuna to bowl and mix.
        <li>Stir Soy sauce and Seasame oil through.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
    Optional: Garnish with roasted seasame seeds.
